We asked 4 questions and each took 1 quesitons to analyze, we used jupyter notebook for our work. We have 4 notebooks in our repo and we merged our branches into the main one for convenience. 


When presenting this is our order:

Ruby will start with her data (age & gender)
Lisa will go next (date/day and time)
Trish will go next (reviews and recommendations)
Aida will go last (cart completion and abandonment)
Trish will do a wuick wrap up of everyone's data


Our proprosal and outline for analysis are in the repo as well.
