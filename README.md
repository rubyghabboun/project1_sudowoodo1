trish_reviews_recs analysis: Why you should care about the reviews and recommendations: 

When analyzing the data this data it was important to look at the reviews and perersonalized reecommendations to know if customers were using them or finding them useful. Essentially, would it be worth it to keep product reviews and personalized recommendations. The data tells us that if you just look at yes and no responses from the customers we may not have a clear cut answer (from this data set, further analysis would be needed), but if you take the sometimes answer and group that with yes because they are using the reviews and recommendations. Then there is an overwhelming response to customers not only using the reviews and personalized recommendations but finding them more useful than not using them at all.

As well overall use of the reviews and recommendations, we found that females are not only shopping more but rating and using these reviews and personalized recommendations more than males, others, and the prefer not to say category for gender. This was also dominated by femalesas was there increase in shopping.
