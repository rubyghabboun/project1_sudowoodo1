The unveiling of Amazon Consumer Behavior

We took 4 major categories to analyze and each took 1 catigory using jupyter notebook.
What role does (age/gender, day/time, consumer reviews/recommendations, and cart completion/abandonment have on consumer purchases)

We have 4 notebooks in our repo and we merged our branches into the main one for convenience.

When presenting this is our order:

Lisa will introduce the project Ruby will start with her data (age & gender) Lisa will go next (date/day and time) Trish will go next (reviews and recommendations) Aida will go last (cart completion and abandonment) Trish will do a wrap up of everyone's data
Our proprosal and outline for analysis are in the repo as well.

our data resource was kaggle.com we chose a data set that covers 2 weeks of amazon data.
